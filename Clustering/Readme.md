# K-Means Clustering on Customer Dataset

This repository applies K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score. Clustering helps uncover hidden patterns and divide customers into distinct groups for targeted strategies.

## Features

Dataset: Age, Annual Income, Spending Score

Data preprocessing and feature selection

Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters

K-Means clustering with visualization of customer segments

### Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Results

The Elbow Method shows the optimal number of clusters.

K-Means assigns customers to groups based on income and spending behavior.

Visualization provides insights into different customer segments (e.g., high income–high spenders vs. low income–low spenders).

### Next Steps

Try different features (e.g., including age).

Compare with hierarchical clustering or DBSCAN.

Extend to larger, real-world retail datasets.
