# Social Network Analysis of Facebook Friends

This project applies Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques to a Facebook friendship dataset, using graph theory to uncover structural properties of the network.

### Features

- Dataset: Facebook combined friendship network

- Graph construction and visualization using NetworkX

### Key network metrics:

Average Clustering Coefficient → 0.61

Average Shortest Path Length → 3.69

Network Diameter → 3

### Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- Pandas, NumPy

### Results

The network exhibits small-world properties with a short path length and high clustering.

Visualization of the Facebook friendship network highlights community structures and densely connected regions.

### Next Steps

Perform centrality analysis (degree, betweenness, eigenvector).

Apply community detection algorithms (e.g., Louvain, Girvan-Newman).

Extend analysis to dynamic or weighted social networks.
